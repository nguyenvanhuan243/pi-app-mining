# BNW Mining Functional Specification Document

## 1. Project Overview

**BNW Mining** is a mobile application inspired by the Pi Network, designed to simulate cryptocurrency mining and user engagement for the BNW blockchain (an EVM-compatible chain with Chain ID: 714). The app allows users to check in daily to earn BNW tokens, grow their mining rate through referrals, and eventually withdraw mined tokens to their Web3 wallets.

## 4. Mining Logic

### 4.1 Mining Session

* Session duration: 24 hours
* Reward calculated at end of session
* Must press "Start Mining" each session to earn

### 4.2 Reward Formula

```
reward = base_rate * activity_bonus * referral_multiplier
```

* `base_rate`: 1 BNW/hour
* `activity_bonus`: +10% per daily login streak (max 50%)
* `referral_multiplier`: +25% per active referral (max 10 referrals)

### 4.3 Referral System

üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë **How It Works**

**Joining BNW Mining:**

* When a user joins BNW Mining, they must use an invitation code (referral code).
* This creates a connection between the referrer and the new user.

**Earning Bonus BNW:**

* Both the referrer and the referred user earn a bonus mining rate (extra BNW per hour).
* The more people you invite, the higher your mining rate can be.

**Security Circle (Optional Future Feature):**

* After mining for a few days, users can start adding trusted members to a "security circle".
* People you referred can be added to this circle, which could be used to secure the blockchain in the future.

**No MLM or Ponzi:**

* This is not a pyramid scheme.
* You only earn from your **direct referrals**, and they must be **active miners** for you to benefit.
* You **do not earn** from the people your referrals invite.

**Referral Code Use:**

* Referral code must be used at signup only and cannot be changed later.

## 5. Backend & Database

* User authentication (Firebase Auth / custom JWT)
* Store:

  * User info (email, phone, KYC)
  * Mining session logs
  * Referral links and tree
  * Wallet addresses
  * Reward balances (off-chain)
  * User-selected language preferences
* Cron jobs to calculate and allocate mining rewards
